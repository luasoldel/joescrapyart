This is where I like to keep my Art! Feel free to look around. If you are interested in any of them just click the picture to get more infos about it.
None of these are for sale, they are just supposed to show my work. 

text, about me
You wanna know more about me? Sure! ..but where to start..
I’m Joe Groove, 21 years old. I live in Germany and just got my vocational diploma in design. I will soon enter uni for video and media design which is very exciting. Once I finish that I hope to work for museums in someway. They have helped me a lot growing up when other institutions (like schools) didn't.
I'm Autistic with ADHD which made growing up a bit harder, that's when drawing/creating entered my life. I’ve been drawing, sculpting and designing since i can remember and i don't plan on stopping.
